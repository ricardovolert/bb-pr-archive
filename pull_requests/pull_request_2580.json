    "description": "The current behavior of yt with respect to \"code\" unit systems to to permit switching a `YTArray` to a code unit system via something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nds = yt.load(\"my_dataset\")\r\nsp = ds.sphere(\"c\", (100.0, \"kpc\"))\r\nsp[\"density\"].in_base(ds)\r\n```\r\nwhich is a bit clunky and not terribly symmetric with the other ways of switching to different unit systems, e.g. `in_base(\"galactic\")`. In the current implementation, the code unit systems in the `unit_system_registry` are indexed by the string representation of the dataset. \r\n\r\nWith respect to this latter point, this is actually a problem, because for stream datasets this representation is actually the same for every dataset, so one would end up overwriting the unit system in the registry every time one opened a new one. The solution is for every dataset to have a unique identifier. \r\n\r\nSo that each dataset has a unique hash within the `unit_system_registry` dict, I've stolen the `fnv_hash` from `selection_routines` and placed it in a Cython file under `yt/utilities/lib`, and used it for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThe other benefit to this technique is that one can now use `in_base(\"code\")` for `YTArrays` with code units and it will work, in the same way as the other unit systems. \r\n\r\nI need to edit the docs, but otherwise this is ready for code review.",
