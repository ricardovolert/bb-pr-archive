    "description": "This includes a number of updates for the install script.  Most prominently, this includes matplotlib 1.3.0 and IPython 1.0.0.  The full list of updated packages is:\r\n\r\n* Cython-0.19.1\r\n* Python-2.7.5\r\n* freetype-2.4.12\r\n* h5py-2.1.3\r\n* hdf5-1.8.11\r\n* matplotlib-1.3.0\r\n* mercurial-2.7\r\n* numpy-1.7.1\r\n* sqlite-autoconf-3071700\r\n* zlib-1.2.8\r\n* ipython-1.0.0\r\n* zeromq-3.2.3\r\n* pyzmq-13.1.0\r\n* tornado-3.1\r\n* nose-1.3.0\r\n* python-hglib-1.0\r\n* sympy-0.7.3\r\n* scipy-0.12.0\r\n\r\nIPython 1.0.0 in particular includes a number of awesome new features, bugfixes, and improvements. The `%debug` magic now works in the notebook, for example.\r\n\r\nI understand that there are good reasons not to update the binary dependencies, however I think it's still worth it to get the bugfixes with these updated releases. If the consensus is to revert some of these packages to what we currently ship I will happily do so.\r\n\r\nI've also taken the opportunity to make the install script a bit easier to maintain, eliminating a number of spots that had repeated uses of a specific package version in favor of one centralized location where we can update package versions with a minimum of fuss.  I've also fixed a couple of minor bugs that have been in there for a while that produced incorrect terminal output during the install process.\r\n\r\nI've also had to include an updated answer test revision due to the matplotlib update. @xarthisius will need to update matplotlib on Piernik to get the buildbot tests to pass.  The answer failures using the current gold standard are caused by a change in matplotlib 1.3.0. Looking at the differences in the plot window answer test plots, the only difference is pixel-level shifts in the positions of the axis labels. I'm not sure if it's due to a bugfix in matplotlib or if it's a regression that we should report upstream.  All the other answer tests continue to pass.\r\n\r\nIn testing this PR, I noticed that `load()` was behaving incorrectly under the answer tests.  I think this is due to a bug I introduced in 5b8b7fa.  I've corrected the issue in this PR.  I've also eliminated a bare `except` in the answer testing framework that made debugging this issue very frustrating.  I think this bug may have been the origin of the answer testing weirdness noticed by @xarthisius last week.\r\n\r\nI've tested this on my OS X 10.8 laptop, Ubuntu 13.04 desktop, and CentOS cluster.  I've also uploaded the updated gold standard to EC2. \r\n\r\nReports of install failures with the updated script would be greatly appreciated.",
