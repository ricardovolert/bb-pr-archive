    "description": "With the release of Python 2.7.4, I decided to take a look at how many dependencies we build that are out of date.  It turns out that many of the packages need updating.\r\n\r\nI've run the full unit and answer testing suite, which this passes, both with the default options, and with all of the optional packages built.  I think the only major probable source of breakage is the version bump from numpy 1.6 to 1.7.\r\n\r\nAll of the files have already been deployed on yt-project.org.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Reverting changes unrelated to the install script.\r\nEDIT2: Falling back to hdf5-1.8.9.",

My concern is that most of these upgrades are not to gain a particular feature, or to be forward compatible, but because the existing packages have new versions.  While I very much would like to take advantage of new features, and ensure that we are not missing any security or performance issues in older versions, it's not clear to me that these have had justified use cases.\n\nI think as long as we ensure that each package upgrade has a justified use case, we should update them; but I don't know that we've done so in this case.  It's also worthwhile to consider splitting up the pull requests, so that we have a single PR for each of the two big features -- here we have both a large upgrade to the package system, along with the bug fix, which is a Nose fix.\n\nIt will be quite nice to have nose operate properly!  :)",
