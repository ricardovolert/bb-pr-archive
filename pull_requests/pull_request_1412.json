    "description": "@xarthisius ran some tests and saw that Boxlib IO was enormously inefficient.  This is an attempt to reduce the total time spend in f.seek() operations, which were mostly unnecessary and were the result of lots of inefficient tracking of the current position in a file.\n\nIt's possible this is wrong, although I did think carefully about the math and the tracking, and there's also likely a better way to do this.  Would be good to get eyes from @cmalone and @mzingale on it, as well as Fido.\n\n\n",
