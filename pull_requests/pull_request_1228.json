    "description": "This should fix the issue @mzingale saw on the mailing list.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a no-op, it just merges on the yt-3.0 branch, then merges yt-3.0 into yt.  I had to by-hand backout some changes that are currently on the yt-3.0 branch, but probably shouldn't be.  In particular, it looks like ParticlePlotter and a frontend for the Charm code are in the 3.0 branch on yt_analysis/yt.  This probably came in as part of a pull request which we didn't see since PRs only show changes on a single named branch. Ping @atmyers as a heads up.\r\n\r\nIn practice I don't think the extra stuff on the yt-3.0 branch are a problem since it is a \"dead\" branch.",
