    "description": "This PR adds functionality to update the entire yt dependency stack from yt update.  This works by first updating the yt installation itself, then rerunning the install script located in that yt install.  I changed the install script such that is the environment variable REINST_YT is set to 1, the value stored in YT_DEST is used for DEST_DIR, which is where everything gets installed.  This is how \"yt update --all\" tells the install script to use the current location.\r\n\r\nI also changed the install script to write the date of the installation to YT_DEST/.yt_update.  This allows \"yt instinfo\" to print the date that the dependencies were last updated along with a note about using \"yt update --all.\"\r\n\r\nI have tested this and it works for me.  The one side effect right now is that if you are working from a yt installation that is not the default (say for development), this will move you back to running from the default repo.  I think this could be changed, but I wasn't sure that we really want to.\r\n\r\nFurther testing and comments are welcome.",
