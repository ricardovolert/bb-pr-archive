For instance, you might have a slice through a piece of a grid with children where those children are a few indices off from the slice location.  I bet with a projection this would be correct.\n\nThis piece of code should do it:\n\n{{{\nids = [g.id for g in plot.data._grids\n        if g.id in visible_grids\n        and not any(c.id in visible_grids for c in g.Children)]\n}}}",
