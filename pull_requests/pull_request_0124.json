    "description": "The SQLite database now is only touched by the root process for both reading and writing when building the merger tree. Previously reads happened on all tasks. This should speed things up (it actually does a bit on a smallish test case) and use less memory.\r\n\r\nI also removed the 'sleep' parameter, and the associated '_ensure_db_sync' function, which are no longer needed. I'll update the docs accordingly, soon.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I forgot to add, I added a _mpi_Bcast_array which broadcasts arrays from root and auto-senses array type and shape.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2:\r\n\r\nThere is now only one mpi_bcast that auto-senses what it should do:\r\npickled or non-pickled.\r\n\r\nRemoved self.mine/size in favor of self.comm.rank/size.\r\n\r\nCombined one bit of mostly repeated code into a new function.",

I would encourage you to split the blocks executed inside the conditional into separate subroutines.  Also, self.mine is not a terribly good name.  There's already \"should_i_write\" and I am also not entirely sure that we need \"self.mine\" when \"self.comm.rank\" already exists.\n2) mpi_Bcast_array is a nice idea, but I would prefer that an isinstance check for arrays be placed into the existing bcast-calling routine and then provide the broadcasting there.  With the two-step broadcast we will a small amount of latency; on some architectures this may even outweigh the cost of pickling!  A final option would be to move this into par_combine and add a new \"bcast\" operation for \"array\".",
