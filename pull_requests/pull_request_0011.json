    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nhere are some fixes that (for me) address situations that led to crashes in parallel hop when not all tasks had meaningful data in some of the communication steps. These popped up after the parallel tools refactoring but were not exposed in the testing suite because the test needs to be run on A) a dataset with only a few halos (so usually high z) and B) on the correct number of processors to make this happen (often more than 2).\r\n\r\nSam - we've worked on this together and you saw the problem(s) I saw, can you be the arbiter of this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlso, Sam, you said you have a smallish dataset where you saw a problem, perhaps we can include that one in the testing suite as well?",
