TimestampCallback allows a lot more user options (which is why I wrote it in the first place) and therefore the function signatures are totally different.

However, in 3.0 (where there are already going to be some API breakages) I will remove TimeCallback.  Additionally, I could then rename TimestampCallback to TimeCallback in the 3.0 for the illusion of continuity.\n\nHow does that plan sound?",
