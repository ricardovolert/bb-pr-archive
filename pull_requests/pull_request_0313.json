TimestampCallback allows a lot more user options (which is why I wrote it in the first place) and therefore the function signatures are totally different.

It is much more important for the ray trace and material boundary annotations to be present.  \n\nTherefore what I might recommend is that I remove TimestampCallback in 2.x.  However, in 3.0 (where there are already going to be some API breakages) I will remove TimeCallback.  Additionally, I could then rename TimestampCallback to TimeCallback in the 3.0 for the illusion of continuity.\n\nHow does that plan sound?",
