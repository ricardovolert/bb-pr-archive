    "description": "The code RAMSES has been designed to take advantage of various patches. Which involve modifications to the main code itself to work with different physical aspects. For example, there is the RAMSES-RT code which also works with the physics of radiative transfer.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains at the moment is the required modifications to the RAMSES field backend to take into account of the fields in RAMSES-CH, a chemical evolution patch which myself and a collaborator often work with.\r\n\r\nI would like to extend this PR to include other RAMSES patches (e.g RT ) and maybe introduce a nice idea of being able to deal with multiple variants of the same code.\r\n\r\nEssentially. In this PR, if someone was wanting to load the RAMSES-CH fields from a RAMSES-CH snapshot, it would be as simple as doing.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!python\r\n\r\n\r\nds = yt.load(\"output_01006/info_01006.txt\", patch=\"ch\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will load the RAMSES-CH specific fields. Not including the patch will default to loading the original fields in the default way. This is the best way I can think of being able to load the relevant fields of popular RAMSES patches and I would like to extend it to include RAMSES-RT and any of the other codes. There is no trivial way of being able to identify the RAMSES variant so the best way is to allow for the user to tell YT what patch has been used",
