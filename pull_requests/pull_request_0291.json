    "description": "This PR adds several new universal fields derived from the vector velocity and magnetic fields.  To do so, I've added some new functionality in math_utils.py to project vector fields onto cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems defined by data objects.  I've also moved the code that handles coordinate transformations for curvilinear coordinate systems from universal_fields to math_utils since the new fields leverage the coordinate generating code.  In principle I could grab the fields directly rather than using the helper functions but separating out the coordinate transformations in math_utils is a bit cleaner, I think.  This should hopefully make it easy to port the functionality to yt-3.0 where a coordinate handling class will do all of this work.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows me to write a script like this: http://paste.yt-project.org/show/2756/\r\n\r\nThe script defines a AMRCylinderBase enclosing an accretion disk in one of my simulations and calculates the cylindrical tangential and radial velocity of the gas in the disk.  It produces these outputs: http://i.imgur.com/67yiy.png http://i.imgur.com/DqG8l.png\r\n\r\nUpdate: For some reason this fetches the coordinates and velocities from disk more than once for my test script.  I'm not sure if that's the expected behavior given the way I'm using BinnedProfile1D\r\n\r\nUpdate: Implementing @xarthisius' suggestions.  Thanks Kacper!\r\n\r\nUpdate2: Minor fix.  Still no tests yet.\r\n\r\nUpdate3: Adding tests.  All tests pass.",
