    "description": "The code that's currently in the repo only finds the minimum or maximum Density.  This completely breaks for non-enzo datasets that don't have Density in their pf.h.field_list.  Even worse, the helpstring says that you can search for the min and max of fields other than density when in fact this wasn't actually possible.\r\n\r\nI've made this possible by slightly changing the interface.  I think this syntax makes sense but let me know if I should change it.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I reversed the interface changes I made, I didn't realize that I could pass the field name via -f option.  I've updated the help messages to make it more obvious that this is the way you're supposed to interact with the CLI.  ",
