    "description": "This is an attempt to address issue [979](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/issue/979/sph-datasets-generate-a-large-number-of). Basically, this gets rid of a huge number of warning messages when loading SPH datasets that were introduced in yt-3.2. Using the GadgetDiskGalaxy (Gadget) and snapshot_033 (OWLS) sample datasets, I've verified that exactly the same set of fields get added to ds.field_info before and after these changes, and that the result of sampling the value of every field at the center of the domain  is the same. But, this needs to be reviewed by people more familiar with the SPH frontends than I am.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is still one redundant field add after this PR - ('gas', 'metallicity') that happens when the fluid field plugin gets applied. ('gas', 'metallicity') has already been aliased to a smoothed, deposited field, and we don't want to override it.  \r\n\r\nOf course, another way to do this is simply to back out the \"field already exists\" warning that I added. I can certainly do that if people prefer. But, I think that having the warning is good since it prevents yt from quietly doing something other than what you expect. Another idea is to only have add_field give a warning when force_override is not explicitly set. ",
