    "description": "This adds two things:\r\n\r\n * yt.imods which contains a few helpers for the IPython notebook and might later have more\r\n * \"yt notebook\" command line utility, which will help with adding passwords to notebooks by default.  Eventually we can subclass the notebook app and add chrome.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE 1*: This addresses Nathan's concerns, but also brings with it a mistaken commit I didn't mean to push.  This new commit changes no functionality, and I think it's safe.",
