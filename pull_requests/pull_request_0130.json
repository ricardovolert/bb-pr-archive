In that case, if I'm going to make a change there, I think I should do what I've intended to do all along (but never got around to doing) and replace the static string with a for loop on the list ''columns'' that uses the dict ''column_types'' to build the string automatically. I could put in a comment about what I'm doing there.\n\nFor 2., I think it might be possible, but I'm not sure it would be any faster. In particular, the loop you're referring to measures and records the relationships between all the halos in one go. If I used numpy.intersect1d, I think I'd have to do a double for loop over every set of identified possible parings. This isn't N^2 bad, but it's still a double loop.

It also now has a check\r\nto see just how far along its gone so work is not repeated.\r\n\r\nThis is following up on this thread: http://lists.spacepope.org/pipermail/yt-dev-spacepope.org/2012-March/001921.html\r\n\r\nUpdate: I merged in the recent changes since I made this PR.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: I've put the table creation SQL line at the top with a big comment explaining what's going on. I've also decided to not try to use numpy.intersect1d right now. I don't think it would be much faster, and could even be slower with all the array manipulation that it would require.",
