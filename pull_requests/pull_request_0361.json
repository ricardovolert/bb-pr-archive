    "description": "This PR is the culmination of the last few that I've submitted, and uses everything that was built up. This enhances the creation of initial conditions by making it possible to create particle fields according to particular distributions and adding them to stream parameter files. \r\n\r\nEach generator creates a particle fields object that has the individual particles ordered according to the grids they belong to. Particle positions can be read in from predefined lists, be set up as a lattice distribution, or be drawn according to some grid-defined density distribution. Other particle fields may be set manually or be interpolated CIC-style from grid fields. After setting up the fields, they may be applied to the stream parameter file and be analyzed in the same manner as any other yt particle fields. \r\n\r\nThis PR also contains some tests for this functionality.\r\n\r\nThe example I have is a bit bulky for an IPython notebook, so I will give the pastebin link for the script and the links to the corresponding images it produces. It generates a refined AMR grid with a beta-model density distribution, and then generates particles according to the density. The density is mapped onto the particles, and this particle field is mapped back to the grid so it may be compared using a slice, projection, and a radial profile to the grid density.\r\n\r\nScript: http://paste.yt-project.org/show/2945/\r\nSlice Images: http://i.imgur.com/mtQy1.png (grid) http://i.imgur.com/Y68Rj.png (particle)\r\nProjection Image: http://i.imgur.com/oyjqc.png (particle)\r\nRadial Profile Image: http://i.imgur.com/6DsLG.png",
