    "description": "This PR creates a new frontend for the open Particle Mesh Data standard.\r\nhttp://www.openpmd.org/#/start\r\nhttps://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard/blob/upcoming-1.0.1/STANDARD.md\r\n\r\nThe current version covers large parts of the standard. 1D/2D/3D cartesian datasets (with one iteration per file) that contain particles and/or meshes in one bounding region are supported. \r\nWe do not fully verify standard-compliance, we expect the data to be 1.0.x.\r\nWe do check for one kwarg (\"open_pmd_virtual_gridsize\") to allow the user to easily change chunking behaviour if needed.\r\nWe do also expect h5py to be present, we import it directly at one point (maybe make it a required dependency for yt?)\r\n\r\nThe current code works with both Python 2 and 3.\r\nTest data is from our github https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-example-datasets/commit/2bb92f7d5fc96ec5259cfcf036fea67ccc32fe42 (example-2d.tar.gz and example-3d.tar.gz).\r\nDocumentation has been written for the essential parts of code.",

If you hadn't used \"hg rebase --keep\", then hg would have warned you about deleting the public changesets, but since you used --keep, the original changes are preserved. From here, you need to repeat the exact sequence of changes that originally followed `b66c329f7017`, so:\n\n```\n$ hg merge e21a8941670d\n$ hg merge 90d511a3e416\n$ hg merge 124453298c78\n$ hg merge 88532ec0be1d\n```\n\nThe changeset hashes I used above aren't random, look carefully at the parents of the merge commits in the changeset log for this pull request.\n\nThe next one is a single changeset on the yt branch that needs to be rebased onto the new branch head you've created. You'll need to get the changeset hash of your new head by e.g. looking at the output of `hg log -T phases -G -r abd04c0::`.\n\nAfter that, you'll need to rebase the `parallel-io` branch in a similar way to the way the `mks-unit-system` branched was rebased above.\n\nThe basic idea with all of this is that you want to simulate all of the changes you originally made. Unfortunately rebase can't automatically redo the merge commits, so you'll need to manually re-merge. It might not be necessary to repeat every single merge, unless some of the merges were nontrivial (e.g. they cleared conflicts).\n\nIf you don't already have them turned on, I strongly suggest enabling the [color](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ColorExtension) and [pager](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/PagerExtension) extensions which come builtin to mercurial.\n\nHope that's helpful, please feel free to ping me offline if you have questions.
