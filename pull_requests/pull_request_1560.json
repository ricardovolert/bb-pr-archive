    "description": "This is the yt branch that we have been developing for the AGORA yt-sunrise pipeline. This branch includes major modifications to the rockstar_interface in order to work with the new rockstar-galaxies (https://bitbucket.org/migroch/rockstar-galaxies), which is the default version of rockstar installed if using the installation script in this branch. This branch also includes a complete re-write of the sunrise_exporter in order to work with the oct-tree structures in yt-3.x. To know more about the AGORA yt-sunrise pipeline see the preliminary documentation here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BzGw1SX4pF9V13QaMyqWsSqTVTBtmSVsOA4DfKbKZo8/edit\r\n\r\nIssues/things that need more work:\r\n\r\n- The pipeline has only been tested with ART-NMSU datasets, and the yt-3.x sunrise exporter has been written only for octree structures at the moment.\r\n\r\n- The sunrise exporter is very slow. There are ways to optimize the sunrise exporter to make it faster,  a good place to start would be to have yt find the children of each oct in parallel ahead of the exporting routine. As of now the children of each oct are found in serial while doing the export, slowing the exporting routine significantly.\r\n\r\n- The RockstarHaloList module in yt is not working. When calling RockstarHaloList(ds, halo_file) a TypeError is returned. Because of this the plotting script in the pipeline is unable to annotate halos on the projection plots.\r\n\r\n",
