    "description": "The selector objects expect data in code units, so we need to be careful to set the center in code units. Currently data is coerced to code units rather than being converted to code units.  This is wrong, since if data is passed in in CGS, for example, the CGS units are stripped in favor of code units without doing a conversion, yielding inaccurate results.\r\n\r\nInput YTArrays representing the center may come from a completely different dataset, as is the case in the halo catalog code, so we also need to make sure we convert to CGS if passed a YTArray or list of quantities.",

This fixes that issue.</p>\n<p>That said, even with this patch it seems that the selector still needs a center and radius in code units:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">yt</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">ds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">yt</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">load</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;Enzo_64/RD0006/RedshiftOutput0006&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">sphere</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">ds</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sphere</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">radius</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">0.2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">#print sphere[&#39;radius&#39;]</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">#sphere.field_data.clear()</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">sphere</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">center</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">convert_to_cgs</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">sphere</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;radius&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Interestingly if I uncomment the two commented lines things behave as expected.  When I was looking at this last night it came down to the fact that if the center and radius are not in code units the <code>chunks()</code> function creates an empty generator.  I don't understand the chunking system very well and couldn't figure out how the selector interacts with whatever generates the chunks, so that's as far as I got.</p>",
