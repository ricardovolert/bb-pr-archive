    "description": "The selector objects expect data in code units, so we need to be careful to set the center in code units. Currently data is coerced to code units rather than being converted to code units.  This is wrong, since if data is passed in in CGS, for example, the CGS units are stripped in favor of code units without doing a conversion, yielding inaccurate results.\r\n\r\nInput YTArrays representing the center may come from a completely different dataset, as is the case in the halo catalog code, so we also need to make sure we convert to CGS if passed a YTArray or list of quantities.",
