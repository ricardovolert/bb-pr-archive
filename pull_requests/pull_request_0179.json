    "description": "This PR contains a number of major improvements to Reason:\r\n\r\n* 3D Scene: isocontours, grid lines, and toggleable display of said items.  Currently limited in scope, but promising for the future.  All rendered in WebGL with XTK.\r\n* The server infrastructure can use a Pyro4 backend to talk to MPI tasks, and all parallel tasks will be executed transparently in parallel\r\n* The server infrastructure is completely hot-swappable, as is the execution engine (for future swapping of engines with, for instance, IPython)\r\n* Completely refactored javascript, which better fits the MVC pattern used in ExtJS4.  This should improve readability, maintainability, and extensibility.\r\n* New widgets are easy to add, and the process for doing so is documented.  (Easier in python *and* JavaScript.)\r\n* Parameter file statistics widget!  Now with field source code and mesh statistics\r\n* Easier plot window widget creation\r\n* Nicer appearance overall\r\n* Camera path editing and viewing in WebGL (BETA sequence -- some oddities still plague it)\r\n* Better help page\r\n* Directly loading binary files when shipping arrays to the browser, instead of array->list->JSON->list->array.\r\n* Debugging mode\r\n* All externally-developed JS is now shipped in a small zip file that does not need to be uncompressed.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it's a nice evolutionary step forward in many ways, and very exciting and awesome step forward in others.  For instance, we now have a fully 3D scene explorer that requires *no dependencies*.  I'm really excited about this.  The next step in this (particularly with the MPI-parallel backend) will be exporting both the viewing angle and the camera path to the volume renderer.  By using XTK we gain access to a number of very nice features (goxtk.com has examples that are quite impressive.)  I'm sure Sam or Nathan have some awesome images to share from the 3D scene.\r\n\r\nThanks to Britton Smith, Sam Skillman and Nathan Goldbaum for their gigantic help with this.  Britton, Sam and Nathan might also chime in with notes about how to test various features.\r\n\r\nThere are still things to do:\r\n\r\n* Beta testing by everyone!\r\n* Integrate editing of colors, opacity and other attributes on specific objects in the 3D scene.  Right now they're all the same!\r\n* The camera path still has some odd translations/rotation effects that make it not *quite* ready for prime time\r\n* Screencasts/demos/ideas\r\n* Develop and ExtJS4-based transfer function widget we can use in the browser\r\n* More widgets: clumps, halo finding, cutting plane, 1D profiles, etc etc ...\r\n* Suggestions for improvement\r\n\r\nPlease direct any feedback to yt-dev -- looking forward to discussing!\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nFixed a bug with Ticks display.",
