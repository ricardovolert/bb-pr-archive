    "description": "Major changes to the infrastructure supporting the LightCone and LightRay:\r\n1) The LightCone and LightRay generators have now been switched over to the new SimulationTimeSeries so that they can now, in principle be used with other simulation codes.  This will require other frontends to add code similar to what's yt/frontends/enzo/simulation_handling.py.\r\n2) Both the LightCone and the LightRay are now parallelized using the parallel_objects function, so they can be used much more flexibly with multi-level parallelism.  This also removes the direct mpi4py imports from LightRay.\r\n3) LightCone and LightRay, along with there supporting superclass CosmologySplice, have been moved to yt/analysis_modules/cosmological_observation.\r\n\r\nThis code has been heavily tested and retains all pre-existing functionality, plus a few more things that will be mentioned in the documentation and cookbook recipes that will be updated shortly.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting this PR:\r\n1. Are people happy with the new location: yt/analysis_modules/cosmological_observation?  I believe that all of this code belongs in a subdirectory together but that was the best name I could come up with.\r\n2. The old EnzoSimulation (yt/analysis_modules/simulation_handling) class still exists, but it is no longer a dependency for anything, and is totally replaced with the new EnzoSimulation in yt/frontends/enzo, which is totally superior.  Can I remove this now or should it be deprecated and scheduled for removal at a later date?\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: Removed the old EnzoSimulation class.",
