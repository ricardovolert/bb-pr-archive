    "description": "This contains a bunch of changesets that mask a relatively minor set of changes.\r\n\r\n * I have updated the ProfileND subclasses to work with the chunking system.\r\n * I've added tests for profiles that use particles.\r\n * Field dependencies are now calculate on-demand if they cannot be found.  (This is a big improvement, I believe.)\r\n\r\nIn doing this, I was led down something of a rabbit hole.  The field names for Stream frontends were really quite inconsistent, which led to a lot of problems with how we did field detection and so on.  Most if not all of this is fixed in the unitrefactor work, where the field have been more consistently named and we define a schema for field naming.\r\n\r\nHowever, here, the fields were not named consistently, and we relied on a lot of relatively unfortunate behavior for them.\r\n\r\nThe final item in my changelog above can be found in the sole change to `data_containers.py`.  This change means that fields whose dependencies are not known to yt at access time (i.e., they have been added after the pf was instantiated) will be detected and added.  This will be integrated more tightly later, but for now provides a fallback.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1: Updated profile plotters to work.  I have not yet added combination fields to the tests, but that can be done later; I think this is ready to go in.",
