    "description": "This PR creates a new frontend for the open Particle Mesh Data standard. http://www.openpmd.org/#/start https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard/blob/upcoming-1.0.1/STANDARD.md\r\n\r\nThe current version covers large parts of the standard. 1D/2D/3D cartesian datasets (with one iteration per file) that contain particles and/or meshes in one bounding region are supported. We do not fully verify standard-compliance, we expect the data to be 1.0.x. We do check for one kwarg (\"open_pmd_virtual_gridsize\") to allow the user to easily change chunking behaviour if needed. We do also expect h5py to be present, we import it directly at one point (maybe make it a required dependency for yt?)\r\n\r\nThe current code works with both Python 2 and 3. Test data is from our github https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-example-datasets/commit/2bb92f7d5fc96ec5259cfcf036fea67ccc32fe42 (example-2d.tar.gz and example-3d.tar.gz). Documentation has been written for the essential parts of code.\r\n\r\nCommit history has been edited so every change can be followed on `yt`",
