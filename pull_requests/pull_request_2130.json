    "description": "I was having significant trouble writing a frontend for a real code, so I decided to write a significantly simpler frontend where all the metadata is explicit and under my control. This is the out-spring of that, and I think it is valuable as a teaching tool. \r\n\r\n# How Does it Work? #\r\n\r\nexample frontend is a \"spoof\" of a real frontend. The file `yt/frontends/example/data.py` generates the data and metadata to be fed into the frontend at runtime. Nothing is ever written to file. Since I'm interested in reading AMR data, I set up a simple fluid AMR output.\r\n\r\n# Why? #\r\n\r\nWriting a frontend, for a yt beginner like myself at least, is hard. It means exposing oneself to the gory innards of yt in a way one has never done before. And it means having to troubleshoot both the API/file format for one's own simulation. The two can collide and confuse the frontend author.\r\n\r\nThis example frontend provides a way to eliminate some of the confusion by removing one factor: the simulation input format. This makes it easier to read and learn from then, say, the boxlib frontend. On the other hand, it provides much more detail than the skeleton.\r\n\r\n# Next Steps #\r\n\r\nDocumentation! I plan to write a doc page that describes the process of writing the whole frontend in detail in a friendly way, highlighting gotchas and things that tripped me up. I will add the documentation in this pull request, so it shouldn't be merged until that addition is complete.\r\n\r\n# Thoughts? #\r\n\r\nAnyway, please let me know your thoughts. This process was valuable for me, so I think it will be for others too. On the other hand, since I already benefited from it, I won't be super upset if nobody likes the idea.",
