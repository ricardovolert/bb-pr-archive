    "description": "This addresses an issue I recently discovered that the LOS velocity calculation is off by a factor of -1 relative to the calculated LightRay objects.  Statistically this does nothing, but it affects things on individual sightlines.\r\n\r\nAs an example, here is a ray overplot on a slice with velocity vectors *with* this PR code (observer sits at the top looking down):\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7lu1bTn.png\r\n\r\nAnd here is information about the ray--the top two panels are relevant and show the ray in terms of absorbers being red/blue shifted relative to the observer: \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8LS5dT2.png",
