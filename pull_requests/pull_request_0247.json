Because of that, could you please add a docstring (in the format of doc/docstring_example.rst )? Thank you, however, for casting to TimeSeries -- that's hugely helpful!\nOK.\nPlease don't use print. This should be either mylog calls or removed.\nOK.\nCalling dd[\"particle_type\"] will load the entire dataset into memory. So, if this is run in parallel, the entire dataset will be read on every single processor. Check the other halo finders for how to do this efficiently. (L63)\nOK - this may take a bit more time.\n\nWhy have all the workgroup creation calls been removed? Are we just running on a single processor now, or a single group? No more IO/compute separation? This should be fine, since IO happens before the computation starts, but it will result in memory over-allocation at startup.\nThis one will also take more time.\n\nPlease perform a merge with the tip, resolve the conflicts, and reissue the PR so we can see how these should be resolved.\nWhere does pf come from within rh_read_particles? Is it now a global, too?\npf is not global, but the TimeSeries object inside the Rockstar handler is. pf just pulls the next object off the queue.\n\n//Is SCALE_NOW only applicable to simulations where the size of the box is comoving, or proper? Is this a generally useful item?//\nSCALE_NOW is always necessary, since it's used for tying snapshots together, and figuring out a coarse merger tree (before consistent-trees is used.) It travels with the data that is written to hard drive, and I think is a necessary parameter, even if it's not necessary to compute (say) comoving distance from proper.\n\n//My biggest concern with these changes is the number of attributes that are now appended onto grid objects. (L98 in the grid object.) It seems to me that we should not be adding all of these. They should either be directly added to the field_data attribute, or they should be held inside a secondary dictionary -- for instance, a .particle_fields dictionary.
