It's too slow to be used in even in just my ART context where it takes an ~20min to grid a few million particles onto a 10 million grids. It's worth redoing before trying apply this more broadly. \nI haven't tested the Sunrise export on non-ART datasets. Having said that, I've worked pretty hard on getting particles (for example) to make sure what I grab is a standard field name, or that at least you can pass them in if it's not. It assumes 3D for dimensionality (so no 2D sims, but I don't check). Octree creation depends completely on grid.child_index_mask and grid left edges, active dimensions, and the coarse-grid domain_dimensions and grid.Level.  So I reckon that's defined for all yt-supported codes.\n\nThe export starts with a single root (coarsest level) cell, or powers-of-two collections of them, essentially building an octree on top of your root grid. The latter is useful in my sims, where the root grid is 128^3, and each root cell may be a few hundred kpc, and a target galaxy may lie across multiple root cells. I haven't tested exporting a level>0 cell (ie, more refined) but it should work.\n\nI want to integrate the camera in the volume rendering with the Sunrise cameras (or replace the latter) because the camera code included in the sunrise export reproduces a lot of the yt camera functionality. However, the yt cameras in volume rendering I don't think have an 'up' vector defined (changing up corresponds to a in-plane rotation of the final image) and Sunrise needs it. ",
