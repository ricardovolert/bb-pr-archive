I take no credit for any of the modifications presented here as of this commit (although this may change with some tidying up).\r\n\r\nEssentially. YT never handled the gravity files that RAMSES produces. This PR aims to changed this. Essentially it is an extension of the fluid field creation, but looks over the grav files as well as the hydro files.\r\n\r\nIt has not been tested in all cases. I will test it out on the test datasets in addition later this week, it might need a bit of a tidy up too. Otherwise this PR has mainly been created as a way to start a discussion about gravity support in RAMSES.\r\n\r\nBen.",
