    "description": "This PR changes the HDF5 file structure for the outputs for the `PhotonList` and `EventList` classes. Previously, these files had both arrays for the photon or event data and parameters, and were all stored at the top-level of the file. Now, two HDF5 groups are at the top level, separating both data and parameters. \r\n\r\nThis is sort of an API change. On the one hand, if one generates photons from scratch in a new run and saves them to disk for use later, nothing user-facing changes. The same methods are used to read and write the files and no new arguments are needed. On the other hand, if a user has an old file that they'd like to re-use for analysis, it is not compatible with the new format. To address this, I've included a helper utility, `convert_old_file`, to take a file in the old format and convert it to a one in the new format. \r\n\r\nThe new format makes it easier to manipulate the data in the file, so I've also added a new utility, `merge_files`, which merges multiple `EventList` files into one. It enforces that all files must have the same parameters, except that one may optionally add the exposure times together. \r\n\r\nAll of these changes are accompanied by new tests and documentation. In order to run the tests for `convert_old_file`, the sample files `old_photons.h5` and `old_events.h5` will have to be downloaded to the test box from the `xray_data` file at http://yt-project.org/data.
