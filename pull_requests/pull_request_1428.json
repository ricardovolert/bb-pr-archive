    "description": "Matt and Stuart - bytebrick frontend\r\n\r\nyt/frontends/bytebrick provides for large unigrids - too large to handle without partitioning across multiple nodes.   This is a poor match for load_uniform_grid() - memmapped arrays are possible but demand-paging gives terrible performance compared with explicit I/O.\r\n\r\nAssociated IOBrick class accepts numpy-like description of a unigrid in an external disk file, and a simple slice extractor which constructs a new reference.   Slices are accompanied by 3D coordinate bounding boxes which are likewise sliced.    The bytebrick frontend accepts an IOBrick, and uses it to do parallelized I/O when needed.",
