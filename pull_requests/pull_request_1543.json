    "description": "Currently, the derived quantities return different outputs that vary significantly between each quantity.  For example, `ds.quantities.center_of_mass()` returns a YTArray, whereas `ds.quantities.angular_momentum_vector()` returns a tuple of YTQuantity objects.  This is problematic, because if you want to use the `.in_units('blah')` functionality, it will fail on a tuple.  \r\n\r\nI've updated a few of the quantities to now return YTArrays:\r\n\r\n* `AngularMomentumVector` now return a YTArray\r\n* `WeightedVariance` now returns a YTArray of the variance and mean for each field listed\r\n* `Extrema` now returns a YTArray of the min/max for each field instead of a tuple\r\n* `TotalMass` now returns a YTArray of the [gas, particle, total], instead of a tuple of (gas, particle). \r\n\r\nThis isn't a huge API change for the user since tuples and YTArrays are typically indexed in the same way.  As an example, I didn't have to tweak the tests to make this PR pass them.\r\n\r\nLastly, I modified the AngularMomentumVector quantity to fix a bug where it wouldn't work with certain data objects like `ds.all_data()`.\r\n\r\nHere is a [script](http://paste.yt-project.org/show/5508/) demonstrating the behavior [before](http://paste.yt-project.org/show/5510/) and [after](http://paste.yt-project.org/show/5509/) this PR.\r\n\r\nUPDATE1: I've returned the `TotalMass` derived quantity to only give [gas_mass, particle_mass] as discussed in the comments below.  The output of the above script is now [this](http://paste.yt-project.org/show/5610/).",

I think that if we are consistent about changing things to match user expectation, there is a strong reason to change.  We shouldn't wed ourselves to backwards compat with something that we have to constantly explain or justify.
