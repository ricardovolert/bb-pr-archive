    "description": "Following the discussion in [PR # 129 yt-3.0](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt-3.0/pull-request/129/properly-catch-maestro-castro-detection/diff), here is a suggested PR that removes castro and maestro from 2.x.  The idea here is that we only have to maintain a single frontend, `boxlib` in 3.0",
