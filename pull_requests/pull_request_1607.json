I just fear that we may have memory issues if we have 1e6 halos identified and each one has 1e2 fields associated with it.  Oh, but I see you're only using the frontend-defined fields and not all the derived fields.  So then halo objects will be somewhat frontend dependent?  Or in this case is the frontend just rockstar?  Sorry for my confusion here.",

For rockstar this means all the fields rockstar finds will be added. For hop and fof, this means that we can now view velocity information (bulk and rms).\r\n\r\nThis PR will be needed eventually for PR 1516.\r\n\r\n[Take 2, this time hopefully without screwing up with hg]",
