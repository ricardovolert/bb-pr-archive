The SimulationTimeSeries acts as a \"value added\" mechanism of adding a few routines, as well as a self-registering mechanism, to simulation data.  This definitely works.\n\nOne question I had was if you see this as potentially being a more flat relationship between the classes -- i.e., TimeSeriesData being the base class, with SimulationTimeSeries inheriting (and remaining basically the same!) and then each simulation type inheriting from SimulationTimeSeries.  This way, they could still spawn off the sub-time series and so on, but it would be slightly flatter.\n\nHowever, I don't think that should be necessary for accepting the PR.\n\nI'm excited about the prospect of having simulation-specific time series loading.  This is really great.  Let me know if you think flattening the class structure would be an improvement or not, and we can go from there.",

    "description": "Created a super class for EnzoSimulation, called SimulationTimeSeries, and moved a number of the methods into that.  This should open the door for similar <code>Simulation classes to be implemented for other codes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I added a convenience function, \"simulation\", analogous to load, but for SimulationTimeSeries.  This enables the following:\r\nfrom yt.mods import *\r\nes = simulation('32Mpc_32.enzo', 'Enzo')\r\n\r\nWith this in place, I will be able to generalize things like the LightCone and LightRay to be usable for other simulation codes.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: the directory of the parameter file given to EnzoSimulation is prepended onto the pf names so that EnzoSimulation objects can be instantiated properly outside of the running directory.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: changed the classing structure as per Matt's comment.  EnzoSimulation is now only a subclass of SimulationTimeSeries, which is a subclass of TimeSeriesData.",
