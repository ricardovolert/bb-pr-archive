    "description": "Created a super class for EnzoSimulation, called SimulationTimeSeries, and moved a number of the methods into that.  This should open the door for similar <code>Simulation classes to be implemented for other codes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I added a convenience function, \"simulation\", analogous to load, but for SimulationTimeSeries.  This enables the following:\r\nfrom yt.mods import *\r\nes = simulation('32Mpc_32.enzo', 'Enzo')\r\n\r\nWith this in place, I will be able to generalize things like the LightCone and LightRay to be usable for other simulation codes.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: the directory of the parameter file given to EnzoSimulation is prepended onto the pf names so that EnzoSimulation objects can be instantiated properly outside of the running directory.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: changed the classing structure as per Matt's comment.  EnzoSimulation is now only a subclass of SimulationTimeSeries, which is a subclass of TimeSeriesData.",
