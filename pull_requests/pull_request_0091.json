    "description": "Now, if you submit a grid field to the ParticleTrajectoryCollection, you can get the grid data at those particle positions along the trajectory. It makes use of Matt's sample_field_at_positions function. The following verifies that it works:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n#!python\r\n>>> fields = [\"Density\"]\r\n>>>\r\n>>> trajs = ParticleTrajectoryCollection(my_fns, indices, fields=fields)\r\n>>>\r\n>>> for traj in trajs :\r\n>>> \r\n>>>    for i in xrange(trajs.num_steps) :\r\n>>>\r\n>>>        pf = load(my_fns[i])\r\n>>>        \r\n>>>        x = traj[\"particle_position_x\"][i]\r\n>>>        y = traj[\"particle_position_y\"][i]\r\n>>>        z = traj[\"particle_position_z\"][i]\r\n>>>\r\n>>>        dens = pf.h.find_field_value_at_point([\"Density\"], [x,y,z])\r\n>>>\r\n>>>        print traj[\"Density\"][i], dens\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nsince the two numbers should be the same. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is VERY slow, since for each pf we have to loop over all of the grids.",
