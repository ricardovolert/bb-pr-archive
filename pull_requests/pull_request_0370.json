    "description": "I added a new set of fields that for doing metallicity dependent x-ray emissivity and luminosity using data tables generated with Cloudy.  This includes two helper functions add_xray_emissivity_field and add_xray_luminosity_field for adding fields for a given energy range, specified in keV.\r\n\r\nAn example is here: http://paste.yt-project.org/show/2986/\r\n\r\nTwo issues I would like comments on before this is accepted:\r\n\r\n1. This is meant to be a replacement for the xray fields that used the old ascii Cloudy tables.  I believe that code was never documented.  Should I add a deprecation warning to it?\r\n\r\n2. This requires an hdf5 data table to make the fields.  The file is 2.1 MB in size.  Is it ok to include it in the source, or should I try to make it available another way?\r\n\r\nUpdate 1:\r\n\r\n- changed the default location for the emissivity data to ${YT_DEST/data\r\n\r\n- added photon emissivity field with units of photons s^-1 cm^-3.  Sample for using this field here: http://paste.yt-project.org/show/2987/\r\n\r\n- added version checking for data with instructions for obtaining the newest data if out of date\r\n\r\n- added emissivity data to install script",

                "raw": "The new version looks great... I make some quick comparisons to both the photon and energy fields what I would expect from the MEKAL and APEC tables and although they are not the same, they are close (though I don't know all of the differences between the two, I don't really expect them to be the same, maybe the abundance tables are different). \n\nOne other thing, particularly for making projections, is that it'd also be nice for us to take into account the redshift of the object, which we should be able to do just by taking our photon energies in the receiver frame and convert them to those in the emitter frame before getting the field. This only really makes sense for surface brightness/intensity maps, I guess. I'll accept this now but maybe down the road that would be something good to add (I would even be willing to do it). \n",
