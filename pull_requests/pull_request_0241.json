I did this so I could calculate light cones and light rays in my simulations, which usually have variable dt_output because of various reasons.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a few other minor changes.\r\n1. Adding a fit to Chandra emissivity that is based on temperature and electron fraction (thanks to Renyue Cen) to the derived fields.\r\n2. Adding the option to specify the colorbar label in a HEALPix camera.\r\n3. In star_analysis, if all of the stars have been filtered out, then return a zero spectrum.\r\n4. Fixing LaTeX \\mathrm labeling and B-field labels.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: Changing default label to \"Projected <field>\" for the HEALPix camera.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Britton has reorganized where find_outputs is specified in the object.  Thanks!  It works for me.",
