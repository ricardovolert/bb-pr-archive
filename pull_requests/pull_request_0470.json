    "description": "This adds a number of answer tests for the plot window plotting routines.  Right now, these test all of the plot window member functions besides the callbacks, which will be addressed in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nI'm using answer testing since most of the plot modifications produce a visual change in the resulting file.  To test for visual changes, I deserialize the plot object from the answers, create a new, hopefully identical plot object, have the two objects save plots to disk, and then compare the images using a helpful matplotlib routine that checks for pixel-level differences in the two images.\r\n\r\nThe tests aren't terribly in depth but I think I've made the framework flexible enough that it will be easy to add new tests as we find it to be necessary.\r\n\r\nI'm PRing this now before I finish the callback tests so that I can hopefully get @MatthewTurk's eyes on this before he goes on vacation.\r\n\r\nLastly I've added blank __init__.py files in the places where we have answer tests.  This makes it possible to run only one set of answer tests by doing, for example, (in the $YT_HG folder):\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!bash\r\n\r\nnosetests --with-answer-testing yt.visualization.tests.test_plotwindow\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: Updating to address comments.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: Bumping the gold standard to gold007.  The new gold standard will need to be uploaded before this can be accepted.\r\n\r\nEDIT3: Uploaded gold007.",
