    "description": "Initial pass at an image class which hold not only the image, but also information about what kind of image, and any other information that would be useful to hold on to.  Right now implemented for the cameras, and seems to work. This also moves the image transposing out of write_bitmap, and sets it the transpose to False by default.  Finally, one fix for the perspective camera brick ordering.  \r\n\r\nUpdate 1: Addressed @matthewturk's comments.  The only thing that doesn't work out is the d.attrs.update, because apparently d.attrs is not a full-fledged dictionary.",

In principle this does not require traversing the entire root level of the hdf5 file, as it could return an iterator that breaks when the first occurrence hits.
